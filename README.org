* simple-git-lfs-server

This is a very simple and example server that implements part of the Git LFS API.

Since this is a test and I am very unexperienced, it supports the basic things to download and upload lfs objects with SSH authentication.

* TODO

+ [X] Create HTTP server that supports POST requests. Library.
+ [X] Handle HTTP POST request and call a given function, i.e. batch_handler().
+ [X] Unpack the contents of the HTTP POST request in batch_handler().
+ [X] Define my own JSON class as an interface to the library.
+ [X] Create the entity batch_response, this will store the actual response to the API call (/batch/objects).

* Milestones.

+ [X] Create an HTTP server and handle the batch API request on /objects/batch. Respond always with a 200 code status but with a JSON saying that the object was not found.
+ [X] Decode the request onto a JSON.
+ [X] Decode that JSON into an object.
+ [X] Process a "download" operation and return always not found for now.
+ [X] Process multiple objects in the response.
+ [X] Implement download operation.
+ [X] The reason why it might not work is because we uploaded the file with Go.
+ [X] Implement upload operation.
+ [X] Reduce compilation time. Improve GNUMake file.
+ [] Setup authentication.
+ [] Impement range http request for download operations.
+ [] Don't use header files for libraries, compile them into an .so or .a and use its functions.
+ [] There are some things hard to refactor, for instance, some JSON stuff like creating an object which is actually a typedef; the http server, et cetera. I am going to leave this for the end.
+ [] Test for errors.
+ [] Support verification request.
+ [] Support all error codes.
  422 - Validation error - Json parse errors?

* Think about what you are doing!

- [] Investigate how opening a file works and understand it. For instance, why are we using a vector of unsigned chars? What is up with iterators?
- [] What happens when we remove objects? Do they have to be deleted from the server too?
- [] If we upload objects that already exists, we do not have to do anything? Not even replacing them?... Weird.
- [] How do people manage dependencies in C++? I do have two for now and the way I proceeded does not look promising. I saw some like conan.io, vcpkg, etc.
- [] How do people structure source code and header files? Project scaffolding.
- [] How can we speed compilation times?
  
* Not supported.

- Ref property.
- Other transfer options that are not "basic".
- Hash algo that is not sha256.
- Authenticated property.
- Expires at property.
- LFS-Authenticate header in 401 responses.

* Headers in UPLOAD operation.
